# Problem 2: Building up the Campus Map
#
# Before you write any code, write a couple of sentences here 
# describing how you will model this problem as a graph.

# This particular graph will be a Weighted Graph. This means that,
# will consist of Nodes, Edges and 2 different kind of weights.
# Nodes will be represented as strings - Building Numbers (buildID)
# Edges will be represented as virual path connecting 2 buildings.
# Weights will be represented as numbers showing the total distance
# and the distance which is outdoor.
# e.g The file mit_map.txt has data in it in the form:
#                10 32 200 40
# which means:
# The map contains an edge from building 10 (source) to building
# 32 (dest) that is 200 meters long, where 40 of 200 meters are outside.

# This is a helpful exercise to help you organize your
# thoughts before you tackle a big design problem!

# Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path using Brute Force Search

# The goal is to find the shortest route (or path) that leads from a start
# Node to an end one, under the condition that the total distance travelled
# will not exceed either the maxTotalDist and the maxDistOutdoors.
#
# This means that ALL the possible routes will be examined. The winner will
# be the one that fullfils the above conditions.
